You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/Home.jsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## What's Inside

### Absolute import

You can absolute import by using `@/`

For example
```jsx
import UnstyledLink from '@/components/UnstyledLink'
```
You can also use auto import and it should work automatically.

When you add a new folder in src, add it on the `jsconfig.json`
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "preserve",
    "baseUrl": "./src",
    "paths": {
      "@/components/*": ["./components/*"],
      "@/pages/*": ["./pages/*"],
      "@/routes/*": ["./routes/*"],
      // add new folder here
    },
  },
}
```

### Inter Fonts

Inter fonts is self hosted. The default weights are `400, 600, 700`. To add more, use fontsquirrel.

### UnstyledLink Component
Used as a component for Next.js Link. Will render out Next/Link if the href started with `/` or `#`, else will render an `a` tag with `target='_blank'`.

### CustomLink Component
An extension of UnstyledLink Component, you can add your default styling for a button/link.
```jsx
<UnstyledLink
      className={`${props.className} inline-flex items-center font-bold hover:text-primary-400`}
      {...props}
/>
```

### Default Favicon Declaration
Use [Favicon Generator](https://www.favicon-generator.org/) and then overwrite the files in `/public/favicon`

### Just-In-Time Tailwindcss
Defaulted to true, you can uncomment the `mode='jit'` in `/tailwind.config.js`

### Default Styles
There are default styles for responsive heading sizes, and `.layout` to support a max-width for larger screen size.
